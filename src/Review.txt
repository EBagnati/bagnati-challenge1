The README is good, but it is missing the clear instructions on hwo to compile your code.
What I would expect is:

git clone ...
cd src/
make

Also, maybe I would have put the parameter.txt in a data folder.

Code design is pretty nice. Also the implementation and the comments are rich, however the muparser and the extras where not done.
